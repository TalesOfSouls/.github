Tales Of Souls is a MMORPG game being developed by Jingga e.K. The game, its documentation, website and tools are maintained in this organization. Most of the repositories are private and only available to project members. 

The organization is using a rather low level and low dependency approach resulting in a lot of self-developed solutions. Primary technologies are C/C++, JavaScript, PHP, HTML and CSS.
